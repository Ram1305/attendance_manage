# Backend Server Started Successfully!

## Your Computer's IP Address: 192.168.29.61

## Important:
- If using Android Emulator: The API is already configured to use `10.0.2.2:5000`
- If using Physical Android Device: The API is configured to use `192.168.29.61:5000`
- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network

## Backend Server:
- Running on: http://localhost:5000
- For physical device: http://192.168.29.61:5000
- Health check: http://localhost:5000/health

## Next Steps:
1. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. Restart your Flutter app (hot reload or restart)
3. The app should now connect to the backend

## Troubleshooting:
- If connection refused: Make sure backend is running
- Check firewall: Allow Python on port 5000
- Verify IP: Both devices must be on same network
